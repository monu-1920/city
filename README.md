Health benefits of running and jogging
Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:

help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise
strengthen muscles
improve cardiovascular fitness
burn plenty of kilojoules
help maintain a healthy weight.
An inactive lifestyle is associated with higher mortality, coronary artery disease, hypertension and stroke. It is also a primary cause of most chronic diseases, as the body rapidly adapts to insufficient physical activity which results in substantially reduced quality of life.

Regular physical activity such as running can significantly improve mental health, self-confidence, healthy ageing, and quality of life.

Running versus jogging
The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging.

Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.

Goal setting for running and jogging
Think about what you want to achieve from running or jogging. Issues to consider may include:

Getting fit – if you're a beginner, you should start with brisk walking, progress to jogging and work up to running. This should take a few months.
General fitness – mix your running with other forms of exercise (such as swimming or team sports) to maximise your overall fitness.
Weight loss – adjust your diet to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, wholegrain cereals and low-fat dairy products. Cut back on dietary fats, takeaway foods, soft drinks and sugar.
Companionship – you could run with a friend or join a local running club.
Competition – running clubs may offer competitive events. Most clubs have sessions designed for beginners through to advanced runners. You can pit your running skills against others in fun runs or marathons. Many community-based running events cater for people of all ages and abilities. Join a local orienteering club to combine running with the challenge of navigating through various environments.
